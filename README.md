## 📊 Task Status

Each employee's task can be in one of the following states:

| Status | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| 🆕 New | Newly assigned task |
| 🟢 Active | Accepted and currently working |
| ✅ Completed | Finished successfully |
| ❌ Failed | Could not be completed |

## 💾 Local Storage

The application stores:
